# Overview

A tool for testing js regular expression.

It is still under heavy development. Only tested on the **Chrome**, **Safari** and **Firefox**.

# Features

 - Subgroups display while global matching.
 - Supports [XRegExp][1].
 - High performance.
 - Works even when offline.
 - Tidy and compact UI layout.
 - Regular expression syntax highlighting.
 - Supports multiline regular expression.
 - Even works on your mobile phone.
 - Supports sharing state to others.

# Remarks

 - If you got any problem with the program, please try clearing the browser cache first.
 - If you want to report a bug, please post with your state code by clicking the `Share` button, if it's possible.
 - If you want to use XRegExp's named groups, three names are reserved:

        ___index, ___input, ___lastIndex

   This is due to a XRegExp bug, hope it can be fixed in future.
